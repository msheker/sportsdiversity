# Sports Diversity Project
Recently there has been a great deal of discussion of race issues in the United States, and professional sports has become a symbol and a battleground for competing views of racial diversity and racial equity. Many publications have tried to show the racial diversity present in sports organizations, but as data consumers we usually just see the summaries and the headline numbers,  e.g. the “Racial and Gender Report Card” from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports. Unfortunately, we can’t really explore the raw data ourselves. Our goal is to present the racial diversity data from the NBA in an interactive and accessible manner that will allow users to explore the data for themselves.
For more details refer to our project proposal in the sportsdiversity github.
